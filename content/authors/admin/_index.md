My primary research interest is in the area of bioinformatics and computational biology which majorly focus on complex diseases (including cancers). In my understanding, computational biology is an interdisciplinary field that adopts computational modeling techniques to answer the questions relating to biology, disease pathology and pharmacology.

The emerging tools based on mathematical modeling have boosted our understanding of human diseases' pathophysiology, leading to the discovery of new therapeutic targets and the development of new drugs. The advances in high-throughput technologies, including microarray and sequencing, has resulted in a tremendous amount of data with an unprecedented depth of value. The utilization of computational biology may help us to dissect the disease-related signaling networks or intracellular pathways, reveal the inter-relationship between disease-related biology processes and provide a panoramic view of disease pathophysiology on system biology levels.
